# Pairs

This is an implementation of a card game called Concentration (also known as Memory, Matching Pairs, or just Pairs).

A set of cards are placed faced down on and the player has to turn over two at a time with the aim of finding matching pairs.

I wrote a blog post on [Matching Pairs](https://adamrice.dev/posts/matching-pairs/) that goes into more detail about the motivation for creating the game and how I hosted it.

A live demo of the game can be found at https://pairs.adamrice.dev

# Future Additions
I don't feel this project is in any way complete, but rather progressed enough for me to move onto something else for now and to enhance later, time permitting.

Some ideas for future enhancements I'd like to make:

- Additional Themes
  - super heros
  - weather
  - fruit
  - vehicles
  - sea creatures
- Gameplay features
  - CSS fireworks or some other animation to celebrate completion.
 - Sound effects - eg. on card turns and maybe at some celebratory sound fx at the end of a game.
